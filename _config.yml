  With over 5 years of experience, I act as a bridge between data teams and stakeholders.

  My proactive approach involves generating data-driven solutions to enhance reporting processes. Proficient in handling large-scale datasets from diverse sources like PostgreSQL and AWS, I utilize scripting languages like SQL, Python to analyze data, identify patterns, and mitigate project risks. I create intuitive, visually appealing dashboards using Tableau and Power BI.
  
  As a member of agile teams, I excel in managing multiple projects, adapting to evolving business requirements, and meeting deadlines.

  I am most skilled in: **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Python** and **SQL**.
